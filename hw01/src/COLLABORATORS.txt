This assignment took me approximately 8 hours, mostly learning how to use Python, such as a
Priority Queue in Python.(2 HOURS ON 1 6 HOURS ON 2)
I did not seek any help from TA, but I did discuss with Andrew Zhang for what the correct
output should look like.
The Priority Queue interface is very different from the Java interface I was used. Using PQ
in the right way and creating a Object to store the distance and data took the most time
